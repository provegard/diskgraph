DiskGraph is a Python utility that creates a graph of how disks, partitions, etc.
relate to each other in a Linux system. The following entities are supported:

* Disks and partitions (hd/sd, read from /proc/partitions)
* Raid (read from /proc/mdstat)
* LVM (read from execution of pvs and lvs)

Because the pvs and lvs commands must be run as root, this utility must as well.

To run it (from the diskgraph directory):

sudo ./dgmain diskgraph.png

Since the only way to watc the output is to open the PNG file, a suggested usage
on a server is:

sudo ./dgmain /var/www/diskgraph.png
