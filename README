Overview
========

DiskGraph is a Python utility that creates a graph of how disks, partitions, etc.
relate to each other in a Linux system. The following entities are supported:

* Disks and partitions (hd/sd, read from /proc/partitions)
* Raid (read from /proc/mdstat)
* LVM (read from execution of pvs and lvs)

Because the pvs and lvs commands must be run as root, this utility must as well.

Disclaimer
==========

See the LICENSE file. The utility must be run as root; read the source code
carefully before running it if you're uncertain as to what it does.

Prerequisites
=============

pydot (python-pydot)

Usage
=====

To run it:

sudo diskgraph/dgmain.py diskgraph.png

Since the only way to watc the output is to open the PNG file, a suggested usage
on a server is:

sudo diskgraph/dgmain.py /var/www/diskgraph.png
